    <h1>Iridescent Rendering</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is to build upon the path tracer we implemented in projects 3-1
      and 3-2 and introduce the ability to render iridescent texture by
      implementing thin film interference, which gradually changes color when
      you observe from different angles. As a result, the rendering under our
      implementation should reflect lights more realistically.

    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
      Iridescence is a very common visual effect as we can see lights
      interacting with CDâ€™s or bubbles in a colorful way. In this project, we
      aim to build on top of project 3 to support iridescent rendering. It may
      be hard to initially wrap your head around the notion of interpreting
      light as waves instead of particles. We attempt to accomplish this by
      implementing thin film interference and accounting for lights with
      different wavelengths as if objects were covered in thin films. We also
      need to account for both the amount of light rays reflected off the thin
      film and the amount transmitted into the internal medium.

    <h2>Goals and Deliverables</h2>
    <h3>What We Want to Deliver</h3>
    <li>
      None of us did project 3-2 part 2, so our first deliverable would be to
      implement multifacet material.
    </li>
    <li>
      Render images with iridescent effect, mainly for objects covered in a thin
      film. We want to achieve something like this: <br />
      <img src="images/iridescent.png" alt="" width="200" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Render images with black body radiation which accounts for lights with
      different temperature. We want to achieve something like this: <br />
      <img src="images/blackbodyradiation.png" alt="" width="200" />
    </li>

    <h3>What We Hope to Achieve</h3>
    <li>
      We hope that after implementing iridescence, we can render oil slick or
      soap bubble, which can have different colors depending on the angle of
      view. We want to achieve something like this: <br />
      <img src="images/oilslick.png" alt="" width="200" />
    </li>

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    <li>Finish Project 3-2 part 2</li>
    <li>Refactor code to account for lights with different wavelengths</li>

    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    <li>Finish as much of iridescent rendering as possible</li>

    <h3>Week 3</h3>
    <li>Finish iridescent rendering</li>
    <li>Finish black body radiation</li>

    <h3>Week 4</h3>
    <li>Work on rendering oil slick/soap bubble</li>
